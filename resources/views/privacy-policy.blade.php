                            services. Your
                            privacy is important and we want you to understand our practices with respect to gathering
                            information from visitors to the Site and with respect to the uses we make of that information.
                            Please check each portion or page of the Site that you visit. Certain portions or pages of the
                            Site may contain changes to the Privacy Statement applicable to your use of that portion or
                            page, for example, certain applications may request additional information from you.</p>

                        <p>When someone visits the Site, our web servers automatically gather information that allows the
                            site to communicate with the visitor’s computer during the visit. We also track such information
                            as the number of visits to the site, which parts of the site visitors select, IP address (the
                            Internet address assigned to your computer from your Internet Service Provider), domain type,
                            browser type (e.g., Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer), date and time of day. We use such
                            information only for statistical purposes that help us design and administer the Site. This
                            information does not disclose Personal Information that would permit us to identify or locate
                            individual visitors.</p>
                        <p class="pt-2 pb-2">Privacy concerns focus on Personal Information, that is, information that could
                            identify a
                            specific individual such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers. If during
                            your visit you personalize the Site, complete an order form, enter a contest, or submit other
                            information to us, you may provide us with Personal Information. We may collect and use that
                            Personal Information to provide you with products or services, to bill you for products and
                            services you request, to tell you about Just Energy products and services which we think may be
                            of interest to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes. For employees and
                            contractors, personal Information may also be used to manage and provide resources/tools.</p>
                        <p class="pt-2 pb-2">As explained below in the section on Dissemination of Information to Third
                            Parties, we do not
                            distribute or sell Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to
                            services to you; moreover, as explained in the Opt Out/Modify
                            Information section, we will make a reasonable effort to remove your Personal Information from
                            our database in such a way that you will not receive future communications from us, if that is
                            your wish. If you notify us that Personal Information previously submitted to our site is no
                            longer accurate, we will make a reasonable effort to make appropriate corrections. To facilitate
                            our efforts to meet your request, it would be helpful if you could let us know the context in
                            which you provided Personal Information, e.g in connection with enrollment of a particular
                            product.</p>

                            identify you, that is it will not include your name, address, or other personal information.
                            When you access an ad, a “cookie” file will be stored on your computer. This information is used
                            to help manage our on-line advertising.</p>
